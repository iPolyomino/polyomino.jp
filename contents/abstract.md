# About Hagi

I have joined the Mathematical Sciences Club when I was a high school student. This Club main activity is researching mathematics and submit papers to the society.

I often heard the words, "Can high school students do math research?" "Only you are special" and "We can not." However, my teacher used to say such words as "If high school students have creative ideas and computers, even high school students can discover new things."

I created a website and an iOS application to convey this fact to many people. In particular, the creation of a website has triggered a major change in my mind. I was moved that we can see the same contents on any device.

In the university, I was involved in the development of interactive projection mapping. Interactive projection mapping is the part of projection mapping in which the projected image changes by audience operation. I was made this application by using web technology. In this time, I encounter the problem of large-scale networking. Communication by many people causes delays due to congestion. Then I get interested in large-scale networking. In the master's thesis, I studied large-scale networking.

I got a job at Yahoo Japan Corporation, which has one of the largest networks in Japan and offers a variety of services. I strive to build efficient and scalable systems while continuously learning and adapting to new challenges.
